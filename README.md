# Trash-Classification-Model
Waste is a significant global issue. Increasing volumes of waste are being generated as the global population and living standards rise. People are increasingly concerned about the production of waste and its effect, and are seeking ways to deal with the problem.

Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. The recovery of energy from waste materials is often included in this concept. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions. Recycling can prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, thereby reducing: energy usage, air pollution (from incineration), and water pollution (from landfilling).
